All Linear issues should be marked as "In Progress" when you start working on them and "Done" when you are completed with them.

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Starting Work**: When beginning work on an issue, immediately update its status to "In Progress"
2. **Completing Work**: When finishing work on an issue, update its status to "Done"
